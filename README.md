### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yi Wei

---

I am a data scientist working on climate and nature risk modelling for financial institutions. An economist by training, my interest in data science topics further led me to explore the synergies with machine learning and deep learning. I graduated with a BSc Economics degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
