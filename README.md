### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yi Wei

---

I am a data scientist working on climate change topics, with a keen interest in developing my understanding in artificial intelligence and machine learning. An economist by training, I am well-versed in advanced econometrics, Bayesian statistics, as well as algorithms and programming; my interest in data science topics further led me to explore the synergies with machine learning and deep learning. I graduated with a BSc Economics degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
